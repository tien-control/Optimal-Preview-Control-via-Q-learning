# Optimal-Preview-Control-via-Q-learning
This project investigates the application of Q-learning for designing optimal preview controllers, where future reference signals and disturbances are incorporated into the control strategy. The goal is to explore how reinforcement learning can be combined with optimal control theory in preview settings.
